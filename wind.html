        <h1>WIND STATUS</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Wind status refers to the current and forecasted conditions related to atmospheric air movement. It provides users with information about the speed, direction, and possibly gustiness of the wind. Understanding wind status is crucial for various reasons, including outdoor activities, aviation, and general awareness of weather conditions. Here are key terms related to wind status:
            <ol>
                <li>Wind Speed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Measured in units such as kilometers per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (mph).</li>
                        <li>Indicates how fast the air is moving.</li>
                        <li>Different wind speed categories may include calm, light breeze, moderate breeze, strong wind, or stormy conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>

        <li>Wind Direction:
            <ul>
                <li>Given in compass points (e.g., north, northeast, east, etc.) or degrees.</li>
                <li>Represents the compass direction from which the wind is coming.</li>
                <li>Important for activities like sailing, flying, and understanding local weather patterns.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>Gusts:
            <ul>
        <li>bursts of wind that are stronger than the prevailing wind speed.</li>
        <li>Typically mentioned along with the average or sustained wind speed.</li>
        <li>Relevant for activities where sudden changes in wind speed may have an impact.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>Beaufort Scale:
            <ul>
                <li>A scale from 0 to 12 that categorizes wind speed based on observed sea conditions.</li>
                <li>Ranges from calm (0) to hurricane-force (12).</li>
                <li>Provides a qualitative description of wind effects on land and sea.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>Wind Advisory/Warning:
            <ul>
                <li>Advisories or warnings issued by meteorological authorities when wind conditions are expected to reach certain thresholds.</li>
                <li>Alerts users to potential hazards, such as strong winds causing property damage or transportation disruptions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        Understanding wind status is essential for making informed decisions about outdoor activities, especially those sensitive to wind conditions, such as sailing, flying, or outdoor events. In a weather monitoring app, users can access real-time and forecasted wind information to plan their activities safely and efficiently.

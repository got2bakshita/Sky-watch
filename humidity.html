        <h1>HUMIDITY</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>"Humidity" refers to the amount of water vapor present in the air. It is a crucial meteorological parameter that impacts human comfort, health, and various natural processes. Humidity is typically expressed as a percentage and represents the ratio of the actual amount of water vapor present in the air to the maximum amount of water vapor that the air can hold at a specific temperature and pressure.

            Here are key points about humidity in a weather monitoring app:
            <ol>
            <li>Relative Humidity (RH):
                <ul>
                    <li>Relative humidity is the most commonly used measure of humidity in weather reports and forecasts.</li>
                    <li>It indicates how close the air is to being saturated with moisture at a given temperature.</li>
                    <li>A relative humidity of 100% means the air is fully saturated and cannot hold any more moisture, leading to the possibility of precipitation or fog.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>Impact on Comfort:
                <ul>
                    <li>Humidity affects human comfort and perception of temperature.</li>
                    <li>Higher humidity levels can make the air feel warmer than it actually is, leading to discomfort, especially during hot and humid conditions.</li>
                    <li>Conversely, low humidity levels can make the air feel cooler and may lead to dry skin and respiratory irritation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>Weather Patterns:
                <ul>
                    <li>Humidity plays a crucial role in weather patterns and can influence the formation of clouds, fog, and precipitation.</li>
                    <li>High humidity levels are often associated with cloudy or rainy weather, while low humidity levels are typical in dry and arid climates.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            
            <li>Health Implications:
                <ul>
                    <li>Extreme humidity levels can have health implications, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and individuals with respiratory conditions.</li>
                    <li>High humidity can exacerbate respiratory problems, while low humidity can lead to dryness of the skin and respiratory passages.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            
           <li>Monitoring and Forecasting:
                <ul>
                    <li>Weather monitoring apps provide real-time and forecasted humidity levels for specific locations.
                    <li>Users can track changes in humidity to plan outdoor activities, prepare for weather conditions, and adjust their comfort measures accordingly.
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, humidity is a critical aspect of weather monitoring apps, providing valuable information about atmospheric moisture levels and their impact on human comfort, health, and weather patterns.
